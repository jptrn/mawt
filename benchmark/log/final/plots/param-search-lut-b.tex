% Okay, the general idea is as follows:
% I want to have have a group of bar plots showing a subset of my implementations vs. PWM, and Kaneta's extrapolated numbers however, it begs the question
% Which of my implementations do I choose?
% I want:
%
% - my fastest LUT variant 
% - my fastest <= 64 bit pext variant
% - 64 bit pshufb
% - 128, 256 and 512 bit pshufb/vpermb/vpcompressb
%
% The first three are to compare Kaneta's methods with the LUT method, the latter are for showing the performance increase with SIMD
% However, how do I know which of my pext and LUT variants are fastest? While I might know intuitively, I first have to show
% which of my LUT variants is fastest, and which of my pext variants is fastest.
% 
% This series of plots shows which LUT variant is fastest
%
% I don't wanna include every single text, since that would be seriously overkill, even though I might
% I feel PCC already offers a decent seleciton of texts
