% i still have no clue how i wanna do this
% doing everything for all texts and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads is way too much
% maybe i can reduce the set of texts to just "interesting" ones
% maybe i can also discard some of my implementations that are not on the pareto front

    The parallel construction throughput in $\text{MiBit}/s$ for wavelet trees using the domain decomposition algorithm.
    We look at the texts of the Pizza \& Chili corpus and our large $16$ GiB texts.
    While the single-threaded performance of \texttt{shuffle64} is usually best, it levels out when the number of threads increases and is eventually overtaken by \texttt{extract} for all texts.
